## Software setup
### Arduino
For Arduino, the executable file has been written and does not need to be changed. However, if you want to make some modifications to the executable file, you can modify the Dungbeetle.ino file in the DungBeetle folder. If you need to rewrite the ino file to the arduino, you can check this web page to find what you might need : https://learn.trossenrobotics.com/arbotix/7-arbotix-quick-start-guide
